I need a local tool for my notebook to organize and edit screenshots.
Key features:

Left sidebar with thumbnail previews as clickable tabs (like a tabbed Paint interface).
Paste newly captured screenshots into tabs.
Auto-add customizable colored border around images; save chosen color as default brand setting.
Add clean step indicators (e.g., 1., 2., I., II., III.) on screenshots.
Overlay/paste screenshots onto existing images in the editor (Paint-style).
Export as .png or .jpeg.
