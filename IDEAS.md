- improvments 

when i move a annotation and want to undo it, it undo each single pixel i moved it. this is annoying and not user friendly. i think it should move back where i grabed the annotation initially

When selecting multible annotaions i want to allign them. horizontaly, vertically, left, right, top or bottom

when resizing a rect the cursor should change when i hover over the corner to resize. else i always think i am gona drag it around...
